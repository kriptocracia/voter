# voter

A terminal-based voting client for the [Criptocracia Electoral Commission](https://github.com/kriptocracia/ec). Communicates over Nostr using NIP-59 Gift Wrap messages to register voters, obtain anonymous blind-RSA voting tokens, and cast ballots from unlinkable keypairs.

## Features

- **Anonymous voting** via blind RSA signatures (RFC 9474) — your vote cannot be linked to your identity
- **End-to-end encrypted communication** with the Electoral Commission over Nostr NIP-59
- **Plurality and STV elections** — single-choice and ranked-choice voting
- **Optional password protection** for your identity using age encryption
- **Keyboard-driven TUI** with vim-style navigation
- **Local state persistence** — registrations and tokens survive restarts
- **No telemetry** — communicates only with configured Nostr relays

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust stable toolchain (edition 2024)
- A running Electoral Commission daemon on configured Nostr relays

### Build and Run

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/voter
```

On first launch you'll be prompted to create or import a Nostr identity. Optionally protect it with a password.

### Voting Workflow

1. **Browse elections** — the client subscribes to election announcements from Nostr relays
2. **Register** — enter your out-of-band registration token to bind your identity to an election
3. **Request a voting token** — the client blinds a random nonce, sends it to the EC, receives a blind signature, and unblinds it locally
4. **Cast your vote** — select candidates and confirm; the vote is sent from a throwaway keypair that cannot be linked back to you

## Configuration

Configuration is stored at `~/.config/voter/voter.toml` (created with defaults on first run).

```toml
[nostr]
relays = ["wss://relay.mostro.network", "wss://nos.lol"]

[identity]
path = "~/.config/voter/identity.json"

[ui]
theme = "dark"
```

### Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.config/voter/voter.toml` | Relay URLs, identity path, UI theme |
| `~/.config/voter/identity.json` | Voter Nostr keypair (plaintext) |
| `~/.config/voter/identity.age` | Voter Nostr keypair (password-encrypted) |
| `~/.config/voter/state.json` | Registrations and voting tokens |
| `~/.config/voter/voter.log` | Debug log (development builds only) |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Global

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` | Quit |
| `?` | Toggle help overlay |
| `Esc` | Go back / cancel |

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `Down` | Move down |
| `k` / `Up` | Move up |
| `Enter` | Confirm / select |
| `Tab` | Next field |
| `s` | Open settings (from election list) |

### Voting

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `v` | Cast vote |
| `t` | Request voting token |
| `r` | View results |
| `Enter` / `Space` | Add candidate to ranking (STV) |
| `d` | Remove from ranking (STV) |

## Development

```bash
cargo build              # Build debug
cargo test               # Run all tests
cargo test <test_name>   # Run a single test
cargo fmt --check        # Check formatting
cargo clippy             # Lint (zero warnings enforced)
```

Integration tests that require a running EC daemon are ignored by default:

```bash
RUN_EC_INTEGRATION=1 cargo test -- --ignored
```

## Architecture

### Protocol

The EC protocol defines three interactions, all wrapped in NIP-59 Gift Wrap:

```
Voter                                 Electoral Commission
  |                                          |
  |-- Register (identity + token) ---------> |
  |<------------- Ok / Error --------------- |
  |                                          |
  |-- RequestToken (blinded nonce) --------> |
  |<------------- BlindSignature ----------- |
  |   [unblind locally]                      |
  |                                          |
  |-- CastVote (throwaway key + token) ----> |
  |<------------- Ok / Error --------------- |
```

### Privacy Design

- **Blind RSA signatures**: the EC signs a blinded nonce without seeing the final token
- **Throwaway keypairs**: votes are sent from ephemeral keys discarded after submission
- **No linkability**: the unblinded token is never associated with the voter's identity
- **Fail-secure**: invalid cryptographic operations are rejected immediately
- **No custom crypto**: uses only audited libraries (`blind-rsa-signatures`, `nostr-sdk`, `age`)
